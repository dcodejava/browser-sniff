== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My device is not being recognized, or I get the message "Unknown Browser". Why? =

Your device is too new or I did not get the user agent string to parse in the code. Send me the user agent string and the name of the unrecognized device, and I'll fix it.

= I didn't like the icon for "name-your-browser-or-so-here". Can I send you a better one? =

Yes, you can, and I appreciate that. Some icons may not be the best, but I don't spend that much time looking for them. If you've got a better one, send me, and if I like I'll put it in the next release.

= Are you the original author of the plugin? Priyadi just have the same plugin you do! =

I'm not the original author, Priyadi from [http://priyadi.net](http://priyadi.net) is. But he discontinued the development, so I contacted him and now I'm the new maintaner/developer of it. I'm an author, but not the original one.

= I don't like where the plugin shows the browser and OS. Can I change it? =

Yes you can, but you need to place the hook by yourself on the theme, and choose "manually" on the plugin admin page.

== Usage ==

Usage is pretty simple.

If you choose the "automagically" option, no need to worries, but it can be placed where you do not want it to be. 

If you want to place the code into your theme, just use the function pri_print_browser("Using ", "", true, 'on'); wherever you want in the comment loop. Also you can simply use pri_print_browser(); and the options will be loaded from database. The parameters here are:

1. String to be printed before description("Using" in this case)
1. String to be printed after description(nothing i.t.c)
1. true or false to display icons or not. Default is true
1. String to be printed between web broser and operating system. Default is 'on'.

The default use of the plugin show something like this:

** Using Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Firefox 3.6.3 on Windows Windows XP **

If there's no recorded user agent string(WP1.5-), strings before and after will no be printed.
If you are logged as administrator of the WP-based site("cookied"), you'll see an asterisk after the print, with the full user agent string detected by Wordpress. Just hover the asterisk to see it. This is useful to see if the plugin is working correctly.

You can also find browser description from an arbitrary user agent string, using the function pri_browser_string("Mozilla/1.0", true, 'on'); . It'll return a string with the browser description. The parameters are:

1. The user agent string to be detected.("Mozilla/1.0" i.t.c)
1. true of false to display icons or not
1. String to be printed between web broser and operating system. Default is 'on'.

** FINDING THE COMMENT LOOP **

If your template is made to newer versions of Wordpress(2.7+), normally the comment loop will be located in the file wp-content/themes/your-theme/comments.php . Just look for clues like "comment loop", or text printed on every comment, like "commented by", or you can just put the function pri_print_browser("Using ", "", true, 'on'); and see where it prints, then try to locate where you want it to be.

Although normally the wp-content/themes/your-theme/comments.php file is used, sometimes it can be the wp-content/themes/your-theme/comments-popup.php, or even the wp-content/themes/your-theme/functions.php. If this last one is used, look for a function custom_comment() or something like this.

I'll not dig deeper in this, but with some time and will, you can find the comment loop. Once you find it, you won't forget it :)
